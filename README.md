## 🚀 Project Overview

**HashSysTech Insurance** uses telemarketing as one of its key channels to promote term life insurance. However, due to the high costs involved, it's crucial to focus efforts on the right customers. This project involves building a machine learning model that predicts which customers are more likely to convert, thus helping **HashSysTech** optimize their telemarketing campaigns.

### Key Objectives:

- Develop a model to predict customer conversion.
- Enable resource optimization by targeting high-value leads.
- Implement an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
